% General construction and classes of explicit L1-optimal couplings
% by G. Puccetti ane L. RÃ¼schendorf

% This code produces Figure 6.1 showing how the domains of two reduced Gaussian densities 
% can always be rotated (without changing their L1-distance) in order to fulfill 
% the symmetry condition as given in (6.3)

% The parameters of the following code are calibrated to obtain Figure 6.1
% Code might not properly work and might require adjustements if applied to a different example

% auxiliary files needed: subtightplot.m
