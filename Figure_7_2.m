% Extra material for the paper
% General construction and classes of explicit L1-optimal couplings
% by G. Puccetti ane L. RÃ¼schendorf

% This code produces Figure 7.2  which illustrates Directions of optimal transport (left) 
% and optimal dual function (right) between discrete versions of the two Gaussian marginals 
% as in case A in Table 6.1. 
% Discrete Gaussian distributions are obtained via N = 500 simulations. 
% On the left picture we plot the domains of the reduced densities, whereas on the right the exact dual function (7.3) 
% is superimposed on the discretized dual one.

% auxiliary files needed: subtightplot.m

% requires (easy) installation of CVX solver for Matlab; see http://cvxr.com/cvx/
