# L1optimalcoupling
Extra material for the paper "General construction and classes of explicit L1-optimal couplings"

The current folder includes all the code to produce figures in the paper. In particular:

**MATLAB CODES to plot corresponding figures

Figure_1_1.m
Figure_6_1.m
Figure_6_5.m
Figure_7_2.m

**MATLAB CODES to produce Table 6.1 (apart from swapping algorithm)

optimal coupling bounds:

Gaussian_OC_case_A.m
Gaussian_OC_case_B.m
Gaussian_OC_case_C.m
Gaussian_OC_case_D_E.m
Gaussian_OC_case_F.m

(notice that SIGMA_2(1) in the paper is SX(SY) in the code)

dual bounds

Dualbounds_AF.m

**Auxiliary functions that should be included in the same directory as running Matlab files:

condition2.m
condition2b.m
condition3.m
condition4.m
costC.m
subtightplot.m (see https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39664-subtightplot)
